# Mandelbrot-Set-Exploration


i think this program is useful for locating an interesting point to zoom in on.
A different program would be used to create a zoom animation at the point found


instructions

open code with visual studio

up / down arrow keys will adjust the zoom of the new frame, indicated by the red box
left / right arrow keys adjust the max iterations of the new frame

click on the form to place the centre of the new frame, indicated by the dot

press space bar to generate the new frame

P key will create a coloured upscaled image of the current frame

the form can be resized to be smaller to reduce the computation required
