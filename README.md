Mandelbrot Set Exploration

I believe this program comes in handy for finding interesting points to zoom in on. A separate program would be utilized to create a zoom animation at the identified point.

Instructions:

- Open the code using Visual Studio.
- Use the up/down arrow keys to adjust the zoom of the new frame, indicated by the red box.
- Use the left/right arrow keys to adjust the max iterations of the new frame.
- Click on the form to position the center of the new frame, marked by a dot.
- Press the space bar to generate the new frame.
- Press the 'P' key to create a coloured upscaled image of the current frame.
- The form can be resized to reduce computation requirements.
