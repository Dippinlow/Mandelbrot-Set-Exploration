# Mandelbrot-Set-Exploration


i think this program is useful for locating an interesting point to zoom in on.
A different program would be used to create a zoom animation


instructions

open code with visual studio

up / down arrow keys will adjust the zoom od the new frame, indicated by the red box
left / right arrow keys adjust the max iterations of the new frame

click on the form to place the centre of the new frame, indicated by the dot
P key will create a coloured upscaled image of the current frame

the form can be resized to be smaller to reduce the computation required
